## What is it?

The idea is to make an app that is something like SoundCloud or DropBox, but specifically aimed
at hosting practice recordings from band practices.

For now, the goal is to provide users a way to drag in audio recordings, and have them save to the
cloud. They should also be able to retrieve and play back these files.

## Proposed Tech Stack, etc...

 - JS-based Web App & Mobile App with shared code libraries
 - Serverless backend with AWS Lamda talking to S3
 - TravisCI

------------------------------------

*Clearly this is pretty rough so far. Hopefully we can get some forward momentum though*
